# React-Dashboard

Hey there! I have been working on a custom project for quite a while. It's a static dashboard developed using React.js, TypeScript, and Sass. The design already exists, but I did not focus much on the UI; rather, it was on efficiently utilizing TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrehan2/React-Dashboard.git
```
